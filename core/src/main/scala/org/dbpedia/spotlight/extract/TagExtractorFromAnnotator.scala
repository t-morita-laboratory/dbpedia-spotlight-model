/**
 * Wraps around an Annotator object to provide TagExtractor functionality.
 * Needs to know how to extract a ranked list of (DBpediaResource,Double) from DBpediaResourceOccurrences
 * Attention: will only extract tags that were explicitly mentioned by name.
 * If Berlin, the Allies and 1945 were mentioned, it is clear that the WWWII is a relevant concept.
 * However, if no surface form of WWWII is explicitly mentioned in the text, it will not be extracted by this method.
 * This is a limitation of the annotation -> extraction approach.
 * Use native extractors (e.g. LuceneTagExtractor) if you would like all kinds of related concepts.
